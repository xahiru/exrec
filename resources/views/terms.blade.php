                    <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue the Site at our sole discretion, at any time, for any or no reason, and without notice or liability.
                    </p>
                    <p>We may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms by email, regular mail or communications through the Site.
                    </p>
                    <p>Except as otherwise stated in Section 10 above, nothing herein is intended, nor will be deemed, to confer rights or remedies upon any third party.
                    </p>
                    <p> The Terms contain the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site, and supersede any prior agreement between you and us on such subject matter.

                    <p>Any failure on Yelp's part to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

                    </p>
                    <p>If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, then only that provision shall be modified to reflect the parties' intention or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Yelp's prior written consent, but may be assigned or transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment by you shall violate these Terms and be void.
                    </p>
                    <p>The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
